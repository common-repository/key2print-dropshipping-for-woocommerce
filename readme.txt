A WooCommerce plugin for commercial printing that allows you to sell high quality printed products for variety of businesses.


== Description ==

**Be the first one to use a dropshipping plugin for commercial printing** 

Key2Print is an innovative dropshipping WooCommerce plugin for commercial printing, that will allow you to sell high quality printed products for variety of businesses. Using this application you are given the access to millions of item configurations, that you can offer to your customers at your prices! This is much different than standard Print on Demand, as it’s not you that creates or designs the product but it is your customer that uploads his graphics onto chosen items. 

Sounds convenient? So let’s get started. 

**Get an access to 500 million product configurations in 30 different categories**

In this novel application you’ll find a range of web-to-print items from business articles, such as business cards, brochures, catalogues, flyers, posters and leaflets, to advertising technology such as rollups, tarpaulins and countertops. As our long-time partner SaxoPrint is a leading online printing enterprise in Europe, you’ll be able to sell products in 10 European countries!

Want to go big? Enter a business worth over $23.8 bln and build your own unique brand of printed products with Key2Print!

**HOW DOES THE PLUGIN WORK?**

The process is simple. First you download the plugin in a zip. file,  install it on your Wordpress dashboard and activate it. Then, if you want to go try out the demo version of the plugin just to see how it works, go to K2P API – and set a “Demo mode” checkbox activated.

If you tested the plugin and want to start selling you’ll need to do few more steps to obtain access to full plugin functionality. 

1) Register as a reseller on the website of our printing partner https://www.saxoprint.co.uk/. SaxoPrint is present in several European countries, so choose an instance of the local SaxoPrint from your country.

2) Send us a form with your customer ID you’ve received after registering to SaxoPrint. You can fill in the form right here at the top of the page https://dropshipping.key2print.com/. This is an extended questionnaire that will help us to gather more information about your company and review them in terms of your creditworthiness. 

3) We verify your company.

4) If the verification process goes well, we give you the API key and now you can configure your products and start selling! 
 
When your client chooses a product in a specific configuration, he uploads the artwork he wants to add to a printed item and places an order. You receive the order and, at this point, using API, WooCommerce automatically connects with the print house. Therefore, all you need to do is with one click forward the order to SaxoPrint, where it gets printed and shipped under your brand. It’s that easy! 

NOTE: Due to the loan SaxoPrint offers you for a start, you won’t have to pay with you equity for the production of items! Instead, you’ll be able to trade with your clients money until the date of invoice payment for SaxoPrint.

**3.2  Setting up production mode**
 
 
How to get into production mode? 
 
If you tested the plugin and want to start selling, you’ll need to do few more steps to obtain access to full plugin functionality: 
 
1) Register as a reseller on the website of our printing partner https://www.saxoprint.co.uk/. SaxoPrint is present in several European countries, so choose an instance of the local SaxoPrint from your country.

2) Send us a form with your customer ID you’ve received after registering to SaxoPrint. You can fill in the form right here at the top of the page https://dropshipping.key2print.com/. This is an extended questionnaire that will help us to gather more information about your company and review them in terms of your creditworthiness. 

3) We verify your company.

2) If everything will be fine, we will send you API credentials (API key and API secret) which will be necessary for proper plugin configuration. 
 
If you passed the verification process and received API credentials, you can go forward with plugin configuration. To enter production mode you will need to go to K2P API. Here you need to uncheck “Demo mode” and select proper system instance ( A country you want to sell in, which you defined in registration form). 
 
When the proper instance is chosen, then you will need do paste “API key” and “API secret” which you received with verification process confirmation. Just click “Save changes” – your plugin is configured. 
 
**Note:** API credentials are individual for every instance. If you want to sell in different countries, you will need to request new credentials and set up a new shop. 
 
**4. Product configuration**
 
If you configured plugin properly, you can go forward and create your first product. 
 
Go to Products -> Add new 
 
In product configuration wizard fill in all necessary information like product name, description, featured image etc. All WooCommerce features work as standard and can be used! 
 
In product data you’ll need to choose proper product type : select K2P product from the list. 
Here you will find additional product tab “K2P Product”, in which you will setup the product. 
 
You will need to choose a proper product from “Select API instance”. This list is taken from SaxoPrint products from instance chosen in plugin configuration. Just select the proper one and set up a markup. 
 
*How markups work?* 
 
You can set your own markup in every product. Markup will be added to your basic prices, including your discount. At the start you will get 12% from the standard prices, which means you can share your discount with the customers!
 
Example: 
 
Base product price: 100 EUR
Your discount: 12% 
 
Your base price: 88 EUR
 
a)    Your markup: 30%
Price for the customer: (100 EUR * (100%-12%) * 30%)  =  114,4 EUR
Your profit: 114,4 EUR – 88 EUR = 26,4 EUR
 
b)    Your markup: -6%
Price for the customer: =  94 EUR
Your profit: 94 EUR – 88 EUR = 6 EUR
